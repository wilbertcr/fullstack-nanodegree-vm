# Tournament Project

I believe there is enough information about the project so I will not explain it again. I will limit this file to an explanation on how to run the program.

Steps:

```sh
$ git clone fullstack-nanodegree-vm
$ cd fullstack-nanodegree-vm
$ cd /vagrant
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd tournament
```
- Create the database and run the test.
